# Weather-Monitoring-System.
Weather is the condition of the atmosphere and plays 
a crucial role in human existence. Scientific 
investigations and important things like residing in a 
location are dependent on the weather in that specific 
region, state, or space. People need ambient 
temperature and humidity measurements for this, and 
weather stations can supply this data. This weather 
station's primary function is to gauge the local 
atmospheric weather observations. Sensors for 
temperature and humidity will record these 
measurements. Every action of this station is 
controlled by an Arduino UNO, and all of these 
readings will be shown on an LCD display.
